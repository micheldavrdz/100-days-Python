# Maze instructions:

# Write a program using an if/elif/else statement so Reeborg can find the exit. 
# The secret is to have Reeborg follow along the right edge of the maze, turning right if it can, going straight ahead if it canâ€™t turn right, or turning left as a last resort.

# Code uses custom website functions to make the robot move like front_is_clear() and right_is_clear(), while also having to declare my own function to turn right.

def turn_right():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()

# I use front_is_clear to make sure the robot first runs into a wall, since it can end up in an infinite loop (on very specific layouts) otherwise.
